# generator-polymer-init-ibm-application

> Scaffold out an IBM application

This template is a starting point for building apps using a basic layout.

This template also demonstrates use of the "PRPL pattern" This pattern allows
fast first delivery and interaction with the content at the initial route
requested by the user, along with fast subsequent navigation by pre-caching the
remaining components required by the app and progressively loading them
on-demand as the user navigates through the app.

## Installation

First, install [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli) using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)
(we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org)).

```
npm install -g polymer-cli
```

Then, install generator-polymer-init-ibm-application.

```
npm install -g generator-polymer-init-ibm-application
```

## Generating an application

Use the following command:

```
polymer init ibm-application
```
